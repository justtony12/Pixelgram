# Pixelgram

This application is a simple pixelart creator made with React, react-redux and thunk. In this app you can create your own pixelart and export it as a PNG or JPEG file. You can also connect it to a backend database and sheare your work online. This repo only contains the frontend portion of the project however, you can find the backend API at https://github.com/justtony12/backendAPI.git.

## Installation

* To install, copy the SSH link which can be found at the top right corner and paste it in to your terminal.
* Once the repo is done copying onto your computer, run npm install to install all the required packages.

```bash
npm install
```
* After all the packages are done installing you can start up the backend or just run npm start to start up the application.

```bash
npm start
```

If you don't connect your app to the backend you will get this cute duck message reminding you to start up your servers.

To start up your backend check out my backend API repo https://github.com/justtony12/backendAPI.git.

## Usage

[View Demo Here](https://youtu.be/eX11hpcQ-qM)


Once you start up your backend and your front end you will see your home page with some art with some captions like so...

If you navigate to the top of your home page and click on the creator button you will be taken to the pixel art editor where you can set your canvas dimensions (note, the bigger your canvas the more detail you can add but it also takes up a lot of screen space).

If you want to remove the pre existing artwork just clear you database in the backend.
